# QA Quickstart

## Run Tests Locally

```sh
make setup
make all
```

## Reports

Artifacts are generated under the `reports/` directory:
- `coverage/` – coverage XML and HTML
- `junit/` – JUnit XML
- `bench/` – benchmark results
- `security/` – dependency and secrets scan
- `sbom/` – CycloneDX SBOM

## Badges

Coverage and test badges will appear here once CI runs.
